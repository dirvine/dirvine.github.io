    	<h1>The MaidSafe Platform</h1>
    	<p>The MaidSafe Platform provides a distributed network that allows companies and individuals to create fast, secure applications that can manipulate data of all kinds, share applications, data and communications between individuals, groups or entirely publicly.</p>
       <p>The MaidSafe vision is to replace today's existing server centric and intrusive systems with a fully distributed, safe, secure and private network for all of the people of the world. A network with no third party being able to intercept, copy, steal, sell or otherwise access the people's data, a network where the only person that could ever access your data, is you! It is our intention that the MaidSafe Platform will become the people's network!</p>
      
       <h2>No Servers</h2>
       <ul>
       <li>No servers = no data centres</li>
       <li>100% server security (there are no servers)</li>
       <li>Impervious to web censoring (no DNS)</li>
       <li>Denial of Service attacks rendered invalid via opportunistic caching &#45; <a class="nonblock" href="opportunistic-caching.html">See diagram</a></li>
       <li>Unlimited data storage with no monetary cost and no transactions</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>No Administrators &#45; Only Users</h2>
       <ul>
       <li>Network automatically configures and reconfigures in near real time</li>
       <li>Privacy and data protection via thousands of algorithms on hundreds of nodes working in tandem</li>
       <li>Network decides in real time where data is stored</li>
       <li>Data caches close to users in real time</li>
       <li>Remove need for network provisioning and planning (hint, computers are better at this than us)</li>
       <li>No data centres, so no data centre staff</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Data Management Security</h2>
       <ul>
       <li>Invisible to users, all data is encrypted in real time</li>
       <li>Real time data de&#45;duplication, reduces amount of data stored</li>
       <li>Real time replication, recovery and corruption repair</li>
       <li>Geographic distribution of 'replicant' data (allowing mass network outage at zero loss)</li>
       <li>Cryptographically secure signatures and key's ensure ownership</li>
       <li>Nobody has access to anyone else's data unless specifically shared</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Password and Key Security</h2>
       <ul>
       <li>100% protection against passwords being stolen in transit (they are never transmitted)</li>
       <li>Three (minimum) distinct system areas with separate keys and IDs (no network link between them)</li>
       <li>Login to system with username, pin and password</li>
       <li>Store, retrieve and manipulate your data with another ID (cryptographic key set)</li>
       <li>Communicate with others through another ID</li>
       <li>For every private share, another key chain is created and shared</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Share any Kind of Data</h2>
       <ul>
       <li>Create private shares between friends and colleagues (instantly and securely)</li>
       <li>Create any number of public shares for public data (thin web sites)</li>
       <li>Create micro&#45;blogging systems</li>
       <li>Create social networking systems</li>
       <li>Share anything, music, programmes, photos, even operating systems with no size limits</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Distribute Applications</h2>
       <ul>
       <li>Allow enormous apps on the smallest of devices</li>
       <li>Share processing, storage and memory across the network, distributing each of them automatically</li>
       <li>Structured data versioning allows roll back, automatic and manual merging as appropriate to your application</li>
       </ul>
