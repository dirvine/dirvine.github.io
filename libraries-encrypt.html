<h2>MaidSafe Encrypt Library</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>
<p id="u1797-4">This is <strong>NOT</strong> an encryption algorithm per se,  rather this is an algorithm that utilises existing very well tested  algorithms (predominantly AES 256 in this case). The library provides a  sliding window algorithm that can encrypt data of any length, even if  written in a random manner (or parts overwritten during write). It is  very useful for encrypting disk based storage of huge data or writing  data encrypted to a key value store in a manner that cannot be  algorithmically reversed (as in reversing AES or similar algorithms).  The chunks of data provided are self checking and the process is  recursive, so the keys output can themselves be concatenated into a  large file and passed back into the algorithm, creating a single key for  any size of data set.</p>
<h3>Overview of use in the MaidSafe Platform</h3>
<p>Data encryption in the prototype implementation uses a combination of  cryptographically secure hashing and AES256 symmetric encryption. Files  are chunked, hashed, and then the hash of each chunk is combined with  the hashes of the preceding two chunks (cyclically) to produce keying  material to encrypt that chunk. This chaining obfuscates common file  fragments. The resulting encrypted chunk is the data stored in the  network, and its hash stored in the data map. The system uses an  underlying peer to peer network based on a Kademlia DHT. This is a very  efficient hash table implementation that has been widely deployed in  many networks of millions of nodes. Unlike standard peer to peer  networks, data can be deleted from the network under instruction from  authorised clients with the appropriate digital signature and validated  ID.</p>

<p>Encrypt overview Encryption is based on the file  content and so known plaintext attacks are possible. However, this is a  requirement of deduplication, and is only possible when the adversary  already has a copy of the file. It is possible to recognise chunks  belonging to particular files, and therefore the presence of particular  known files on the system, but it is not possible to tie those chunks to  a particular user.</p>
<p id="u1832-30">Files are always split into a minimum of three  chunks (smaller files are encoded within the data map directly for  efficiency), so the probability of simultaneous collisions on all file  chunk hashes are small enough to be ignored.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Extremely secure data encryption</li>
  <li>Very high speed, due to parallel algorithms  making use of multi cores [previous version measured read and write at  over 1Gb/s with ease in an SSD raid 5 system that achieves only ~300Mbs  with raw data]</li>
  <li>Can handle out of sequence reads and concurrent out of sequence writes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Programming languages</h3>
<h3>Core</h3>
<p>C++11 compatible with GCC (4.7 and above), Clang (3.3 and above) and  MSVC 2012 (with no dependency on CTP releases). Tested on Windows 32/64  bit, Linux 32/64 bit (dependent on GCC version) and OSX (Mountain Lion  and above).</p>
<h3>Status</h3>
<p>This library is considered <strong>BETA</strong> quality and  is provided with a full test suite and QA suite. This can be considered  for use in production quality systems at this time.</p>

<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Upgrade to Generic programming</li>
  <li>Implement exceptions and exception safety</li>
  <li>Rewrite to C++11 standards (use std::array and vector specifically to improve safety) especially move aware containers.</li>
</ul>
