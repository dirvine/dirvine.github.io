<h2>LifeStuff Library</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>
<p id="u1931-8">Lifestuff is a relatively thin wrapper library that provides a client <a href="https://github.com/maidsafe/LifeStuff/wiki" target="_blank">API</a> to  the MaidSafe network. This allows data storage and manipulation  (structured and unstructured), reliable and secure communications and  the ultimate privacy protection for people using the network and  associated applications. This library provides the API that allows data  sharing, both public and private.</p>
<p id="u1931-10">Public shares allow the creation and running of  web sites, blogs, microblogs, social networks which in turn allow people  to share ideas, research, suggestions and hope!</p>
<p id="u1931-12">This library allows many applications to be built  that can provide the features listed and much more, this is a prime  reason to open up the complete suite of MaidSafe libraries and  applications to every developer in the world.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Login to your own data, wherever that may be</li>
  <li>Login to a 100% server-free network</li>
  <li>100% protection against passwords being stolen in transit (they are never transmitted)</li>
  <li>100% server security (there are no servers)</li>
  <li>Impervious to web censoring (no DNS)</li>
  <li>Websites stored on public shares get faster as more people wish to visit it (logical)</li>
  <li>Denial of Service attacks rendered invalid</li>
  <li>Ability to store virtual wallets with extreme levels of security (bitcoin included)</li>
  <li>Share any information, including applications with zero intermediaries</li>
  <li>Unlimited data storage with no monetary cost  and no transactions (users must provide hard drive space, CPU and  bandwidth though)</li>
  <li>Anything the web can do plus anything  developers can conceive given the freedom to innovate in such a secure,  free and private network that automatically scales with their user base</li>
</ul>
<h3>Programming languages</h3>
<h3>Core</h3>
<p>C++11 compatible with GCC (4.7 and above), Clang (3.3 and above) and  MSVC 2012 (with no dependency on CTP releases). Tested on Windows 32/64  bit, Linux 32/64 bit (dependent on GCC version) and OSX (Mountain Lion  and above).</p>
<h3>Status</h3>
<p>This library is considered <strong>ALPHA</strong> quality and  is provided with a full test suite and QA suite. Developers should be  aware of this ALPHA state if considering using this library for  production quality systems at this time. There are very small API  changes required to tie this library to the <a href="http://www.maidsafe.net/libraries-network-file-system.html">Network Filesystem</a> code on completion of that library (imminent).</p>

<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Introduce further type safety</li>
  <li>Allow LifeStuff to authenticate computer users natively (log into any computer/phone and make it yours)</li>
  <li>Create Android and IOS ports as a matter of urgency</li>
  <li>Garner feedback on ensuring ease of use of API</li>
</ul>
