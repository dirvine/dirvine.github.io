    <h1>MaidSafe-RUDP</h1>
<h2>Implementation of Reliable UDP</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>
<p id="u1797-4">TCP is a reliable connection oriented protocol that  cannot traverse NAT routers (with any real capability) UDP is an  unreliable connectionless protocol that can traverse many NAT routers  with ease.</p>
<p id="u1797-10">MaidSafe-RUDP is a reliable pseudo connected  protocol that can traverse more NAT routers than plain UDP when used in  conjunction with <a href="http://www.maidsafe.net/libraries-routing.html">MaidSafe-Routing</a>. It is impervious to 'man in the middle' attacks with no requirement for a key exchange protocol to exist at the network level.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Implements hundreds / thousands of connections per computer (depending on hardware)</li>
  <li>Provides encrypted communications (keys can be passed into API per connection)</li>
  <li>Used in conjunction with <a href="http://www.maidsafe.net/libraries-routing.html">MaidSafe-Routing</a> this library implements a network that is entirely resistant to 'man in the middle' attacks</li>
  <li>Used in conjunction with <a href="http://www.maidsafe.net/libraries-routing.html">MaidSafe-Routing</a> this library implements a network that can traverse even symmetric NAT routers</li>
  <li>Capable of multiplexing multiple RUDP connections to single UDP port (increasing connection capabilities)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Programming languages</h3>
<h3>Core</h3>
<p>C++11 compatible with GCC (4.7 and above), Clang (3.3 and above) and  MSVC 2012 (with no dependency on CTP releases). Tested on Windows 32/64  bit, Linux 32/64 bit (dependent on GCC version) and OSX (Mountain Lion  and above).</p>
<h3>Status</h3>
<p>This library is considered <strong>BETA</strong> quality and  is provided with a full test suite and QA suite. This can be considered  for use in production quality systems at this time. There is currently a  limit on message size that requires attention at the earliest  convenience.</p>

<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Refactor for type safety</li>
  <li>Refactor for exception handling</li>
  <li>Implement a data channel or interleaved message handling (to remove any size restrictions)</li>
  <li>Further work on rejecting slowing nodes (potential damage caused by hack attempts including slowing connections down)</li>
  <li>Improve messages per second capability (throughput), which is currently circa 8000 for 100 Byte messages</li>
</ul>
